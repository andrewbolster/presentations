# Dr. StrangeBot - RSA Conference 2026

**How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Historical Security Data**

Presentation by Andrew Bolster, PhD
Senior Manager of Cybersecurity & R&D, Black Duck

## Overview

This talk challenges the "single pane of glass" approach to security data consolidation and presents a federated data governance model optimized for AI consumption. Using the three-party co-certification framework (Engineering × GRC × Data Science), it demonstrates how organizations can build trust contracts for messy, distributed security data.
